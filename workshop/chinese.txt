Open Angel Arena is a modern reimagining of the classic Angel Arena game mode.

[list]
[*][b]All heroes are viable[/b], including supports, casters and tanks. In fact, supports are absolutely essential to many strategies.
[*][b]All items are upgradeable.[/b] This allows for a wide range of possible item builds and for an even wider range of possible strategies. Have you ever wanted to play attack damage Elder Titan using the 100% lifesteal talent or use Luna's ultimate to rain death and stuns on an entire team? In Open Angel Arena these strategies are not only possible but actually viable.
[*][b]New custom items[/b], designed by the community and carefully balanced before being added.
[*][b]Bosses have been redesigned to be an integral part of the game and have been made more interesting.[/b] To upgrade items you have to kill bosses, often as early as 10 minutes into the game and then regularly for the rest of the match. A killed boss respawns as a new, stronger boss with new abilities. Bosses in OAA have abilities that you have to deal with while battling them and aren’t simple DPS tanks.
[*][b]Duels have been redesigned to include objectives that encourage players to fight and enable objective based gameplay.[/b] There are multiple different duel arenas that you can be placed into and you will always be playing in a duel. If there is a 1v1 in one arena there is also a 4v4 in a different one and so on.
[*][b]To win the game you must win a Final Duel.[/b] The first team to 100 points will trigger a Final Duel.[b] The team with 100 points then needs to win this Final Duel to win the game.[/b] If they don’t then the games score limit gets extended by 10, putting it into overtime. This goes on until a team wins a Final Duel.
[*]Fountain camping has been eliminated from the game.
[*]Our custom music is amazing!

Open Angel Arena is an open source project. There's lots of cool stuff we have designed, if you'd like to help create them check out [url=https://github.com/OpenAngelArena/oaa]our GitHub[/url]. We are always looking for new people to help with the game. It’s a fun experience and if you are a new developer the best experience you can get is to simply work on a game. If you work on Open Angel Arena you can also get feedback on your work by professional developers. You can find the developer discord in the installation instructions on GitHub.
