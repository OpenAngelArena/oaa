# Using these files:
- npc_items_custom.txt - Put this in your /npc folder and you'll get the 274 total current items in the OAA project.
- npc_abilities_custom.txt - This is important. As of yet no *new* abilities have been made for the OAA project, but we will probably add some soon.
- npc_abilities_override.txt - Put this in your /npc folder and you'll get the 492 modified hero abilities for the OAA project.
- /abilities/*files* - these are the individual files which comprise npc_abilities_override.txt. They're not important unless we need to change something.
- /items/*files* - these are the individual files which comprise npc_items_custom.txt. They're not important unless we need to change something.
