Images in **items** folder and its subfolders are for the items icons in shop (e.g. when you hover over an item in the shop).
Do not put icons for items that have different forms (actives, inactives and similar) and do not put icons for items that don't show in shop and cannot be found with shop search.

**content\panorama\layout\custom_game\precache.xml** needs to be edited so the console doesn't give a red error how the icon cannot be found. 
(only 1st lvl of the item needs to be referenced, it is enough for some reason)
